# Pymage-Editor
- (Pronounced pih-midge)

A simple image editor made in Python using Tkinter and Pillow. This is a random project I was working on to give myself a somewhat useful tool and to get better at Python. There are much better image editors out there such as GIMP and there are much better languages to write image editors with. That said, I usually only need a few things and I hate looking up random tools like "image resizer" and sometimes I don't want to take the time to sift through GIMP to find a specific tool (no hate to GIMP) so here we are.

### Features:
- Opening and Saving images
- Image Manipulation: Image Rotation, Resizing, Flipping, and Mirroring
- Image Effects: Blur, Contour, Detail, Edge Enhance, Emboss, Find Edges, Sharpen, Smooth
- Filters: Grayscale
- History: Includes a history window to show past image actions. Also allows for undoing and redoing
- Image movement: Ability to drag image around the canvas

*Notes*:

This is a work in progress with a lot more to add, but I feel as if this is pretty good for now. Will come back later!
